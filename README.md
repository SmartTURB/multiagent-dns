# Multiagent olfactory search in a 3D turbulent environment
The code is written in C++. It has been developed to study multi-agent olfactory search policies in a turbulent 3D environment. We evaluate the performance of groups of agents sharing a probability map about the odor source location and cooperating to reach it quickly. Assigning different search heuristic strategies to the agents (infotaxis, space-aware infotaxis, or greedy), we observe an improved performance compared to homogeneous groups using the same heuristic policy.

The Dataset of Lagrangian odor particle trajectories used in the code is available for download in the Smart-TURB portal http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it, under the TURB-Odor repository.
